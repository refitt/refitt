  Turn a shaped spec/{slug}/GOAL.md into a design and a phased roadmap. Runs an invariant gate against

  spec/{slug}/PLAN.md, re-checks invariants, and generates spec/{slug}/TECH.md — the phased YAML-FSM

# rf-plan — research → PLAN → TECH

## When to Use

Invoke `/rf-plan` after `/rf-feature` has landed a quality `GOAL.md` on a feature/fix branch. It
produces the design (`PLAN.md`), optional backing `research/`, and the phased FSM (`TECH.md`), then
stops for your sign-off before `/rf-build` touches code. Depth scales to the GOAL's `appetite`.

Reference: [`.agents/factory/methodology.md`](../../factory/methodology.md),
[`.agents/factory/invariants.md`](../../factory/invariants.md) (the gate),
templates [`PLAN.md`](../../factory/templates/PLAN.md) / [`TECH.md`](../../factory/templates/TECH.md).

**Harness portability.** Runs on any harness — see [`factory/portability.md`](../../factory/portability.md).
Fallbacks: if the *Current state* block isn't auto-injected, run those commands yourself in Step 1; ask
in plain text and STOP if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable; and **if subagents are unavailable, do the
research fan-out sequentially yourself** (Step 3 gives the fallback). Everything else is portable shell.

## User Instructions

Additional instructions provided with the invocation: $ARGUMENTS

## Current state (injected at load)

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Tree: !`git status --porcelain | head -n 20`
- Spec artifacts: !`ls -1 spec/*/ 2>/dev/null | head -n 40`

## Argument Parsing

- `skip research` / `no research` → collapse to a lean plan (no fan-out) regardless of appetite.
- `appetite small|big` → override the GOAL's appetite for this planning run.
- `status` / `report` → summarize what artifacts already exist for this slug and what's missing; no work.

## Safety Principles

- **On a feature/fix branch, never `develop`/`master`.** Derive `{slug}` = branch minus its
  `feature/`|`fix/` prefix. STOP if on a base branch or the tree is dirty.
- **`GOAL.md` must exist, be committed, and carry no unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.** If
  markers remain, STOP and send the human back to `/rf-feature`.
- **Research is strictly read-only** and biased to the codebase (this is a self-contained repo); use
  the web only for genuinely external unknowns. Keep briefs minimal — only what informs `PLAN.md`.
- **Never build.** No source edits, no implementation. That's `/rf-build`.
- **The invariant gate is mandatory** (both checkpoints). Any bend gets recorded in PLAN's deviation
  table, never applied silently.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Pre-flight & load
1. Confirm feature/fix branch + clean tree; resolve `{slug}`.
2. Read `spec/{slug}/GOAL.md` (appetite, R-IDs, non-goals). Read
   [`invariants.md`](../../factory/invariants.md).

### Step 2 — Invariant gate #1 (pre-research sanity)
Given the GOAL's intent, list the invariant sections (`invariants.md` §1–§8 / §C1–§C4 / §K) this
change will touch and confirm the intent is even sane against them (e.g. a schema change must respect
the schema dual source of truth (§C1) and the no-migrations reality (§C2); an auth change must respect
the inverted status mapping and constant-time secret compare (§5)). If the GOAL is fundamentally at
odds with an invariant, STOP and escalate.

### Step 3 — Research fan-out (appetite-scaled)
- **`appetite: small` / `kind: fix` / `skip research`:** skip the fan-out. Do at most a couple of
  targeted reads yourself. Proceed to Step 4 with a lean plan; `research/` may be omitted.
  **Exception — diagnostic fixes:** when the GOAL's root cause is *unknown* or it explicitly requests
  diagnosis (an unreproducible failure, an `appetite: … — diagnosis-gated` qualifier), run the full
  fan-out regardless of `kind`/`appetite` — for such a fix the investigation *is* the deliverable, and
  skipping it yields a test-only guess. `kind`/`appetite` are proxies for "is the root cause known?";
  when they disagree with the GOAL, the GOAL wins. (An explicit `skip research` argument stays a human
  override and still skips.)
- **`appetite: big`:** identify the *rabbit holes* — the scary unknowns that could blow the appetite
  (unfamiliar code paths, algorithmic choices, external tech, perf at scale, dialect differences).
  Launch **read-only research subagents in parallel** (Agent tool), one per topic, breadth-first:
  - Each gets: the topic + GOAL context + explicit scope boundaries + "produce a ≈1–2k-token brief
    and **write it to `spec/{slug}/research/NN-topic.md`**" (use `general-purpose` so it can write;
    number `01`, `02`, … with distinct paths so there are no write conflicts). Prefer
    codebase-exploration; reserve `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` for external unknowns.
  - Scale count to appetite (a few for medium features; more for large). Log what you fan out.
  - **Consume each agent's returned summary; never read its `.output` transcript sidecar** — it can
    flood your context. **No subagents in your harness?** Do the research yourself, sequentially,
    writing the same `spec/{slug}/research/NN-topic.md` files — identical output, only parallelism lost.
- Read the returned briefs and synthesize **`spec/{slug}/research/00-digest.md`** — the consolidated
  decisions that resolve any cross-brief contradictions with a single recommendation each.

### Step 4 — Write `PLAN.md`
From the template: **Summary**, **Design** at architecture altitude (reference concrete
`py/libs/refitt-*/src/refitt/…` / `py/apps/refitt-*/src/refitt/…` files), the **requirement → design
map** (every R-ID covered), **rabbit holes resolved** (link briefs), **risks/open questions**,
**verification strategy** (seeds the per-phase `verify:` commands). REFITT's verify substrate is
two-tier: `.agents/factory/bin/temp_db.sh sh -c "…"` (fast throwaway SQLite — core/data/most model
unit phases; **cannot** run Postgres-only SQL (the `->>` operator, §C4) or the live server/API) and
`.agents/factory/bin/temp_pg.sh sh -c "…"` (ephemeral Postgres — server/API/broker/integration
phases; prefix `REFITT_TEMP_WITH_SERVER=1` to also launch `refitt-server`). There is **no single
product binary**: each `verify:` names the CLI (`refitt` / `refitt-server` / `refitt-client` /
`refitt-broker` / `refitt-tns`) and/or the `uv run pytest` selection relevant to the change.

### Step 5 — Invariant gate #2 (post-design)
Re-walk the touched invariant sections against the *drafted design*. Fill PLAN's **deviation
justification table** for anything that bends an invariant or adds complexity (with the simpler
alternative and why it was rejected). Empty is the goal. STOP and escalate on an unavoidable
CRITICAL (Tier 1, §1–§8) invariant conflict.

### Step 6 — Generate `TECH.md` (the FSM)
Copy the template; author phases as **vertical slices, not horizontal layers** — each independently
verifiable end-to-end, ordered **core + small + novel first**. **Size circuit-breaker (soft):** if the
roadmap needs **>~8 phases**, the scope is probably too big for one unit of work — pause and reconsider
with the human (split into a pilot + follow-ups, or trim to the appetite) before committing a mega-plan.
For each phase set: `id`, `name`, `satisfies` (R-IDs), `depends_on`, `parallel` (**false** for
high-blast-radius core — the `database/{model,connection,core}.py`, `core/{config,logging,platform}.py`,
`api/{token,response,request}.py`, and `server/{app,auth,endpoint,tools}.py` + `route/*.py` files;
`true` only for independent work — a standalone app module, docs, or tests), `hammerable` (**false**
for correctness/security phases), `hill: uphill`, and a real `verify:` command. Foundational
schema/model changes must land and pass **before** dependent server/client phases. Set top
`status: in_progress`, `current_phase` to the first phase, `last_updated` today. Then **validate**:
`uv run python .agents/factory/bin/next_phase.py spec/{slug}/TECH.md` must exit 0 and report the first
phase.

### Step 7 — Meta-note (self-improvement loop · silence by default)
Before committing, reflect on the **skillset itself** — not the task, not the code. Write nothing
unless the bar is met.

**The bar (one test):** *was this the skill's fault — not mine, not the task's?* **Qualifies:** you
hand-fixed a command this skill gave (wrong flag/path, unquoted `verify:` YAML); a genuinely ambiguous
instruction; a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` that better guidance could have pre-empted; an
allowed-tools/step mismatch; a gate that passed or failed misleadingly. **Stay silent for:** a merely
hard task; your own error against clear guidance; a one-off content/code issue (→ `PLAN.md`/`GOAL.md`,
not here); a vague preference.

If (and only if) the bar is met, record it in `spec/{slug}/META.md` (create from
[`templates/META.md`](../../factory/templates/META.md) if absent, else append). You may also add a
one-line **What worked well** note when a part of this skill materially helped. Caps: **≤3 findings**,
terse; if an equivalent finding already exists, append "· seen again" rather than duplicating; a fix
that would weaken a non-negotiable gate (the invariant gate, the `verify:` design, an `invariants.md`
item) is `severity=high` and must say so. **Records only** — `/rf-harness` applies fixes later,
human-reviewed. Use the next unused `F#`; always write `status=open`; append the finding as a section
**outside** any code fence:
```markdown
## F<n> — <one-line title>
`origin=rf-plan:<step> severity=<high|medium|low> category=<instruction|steering|tooling|template|missing-guidance> status=open target=<best-guess file>`
- **What happened:** <what the skill made you do, or fail to do>.
- **Skill cause:** <why it's the instructions' fault — not yours, not the task's>.
- **Recommended fix:** <the change to the skill/template/script>.
- **Confidence:** <high|med|low> · **Effort:** <small|medium|large>
```
Likely sources here: the research fan-out mechanics (Step 3), the invariant-gate steps, or
`TECH.md`/YAML authoring.

### Step 8 — Commit
```
git add -A spec/{slug}      # PLAN.md + TECH.md, plus research/ and META.md when present (research/ is omitted on the lean path)
git commit -m "[{category}] Plan {slug}: design + phased roadmap"
```
`{category}` = `fix`|`feature`. **No `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** Do not push.

### Step 9 — Report & hand off
Report the design summary, the phase list (id · name · satisfies · verify), any deviations recorded,
and open risks. Sign-off gate: the human reviews `PLAN.md`/`TECH.md`; then `/rf-build` executes phase
one. Stop.

## Examples

- `/rf-plan` — full appetite-scaled run for the current branch's slug.
- `/rf-plan skip research` — lean plan for a small change (no fan-out).
- `/rf-plan status` — list existing GOAL/research/PLAN/TECH for this slug and what's missing.

## Notes

- For a very large fan-out you may ask the human whether to use the `Workflow` tool instead of ad-hoc
  `Agent` calls — but default to `Agent` fan-out here.
- Keep `research/` lean: reviewers and future readers pay a tax for sprawl. Only keep what informs the
  design.
- `TECH.md` is the resume ground-truth for `/rf-build`; if `next_phase.py` reports it invalid, fix it
  before committing.
