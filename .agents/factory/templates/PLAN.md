# PLAN — {Title}

> **Status:** Draft for review · **Last updated:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
> **Authoritative technical design.** The *how*. Vision/contract is [`GOAL.md`](GOAL.md);
> the phased executable roadmap is [`TECH.md`](TECH.md). Backing detail is in
> [`research/`](research/) (when `appetite: big`). Every design element traces to a GOAL R-ID.

## 1. Summary

<2–4 sentences: the approach in a nutshell and why it fits the appetite.>

## 2. Design

<The real technical design at architecture altitude: data model / schema changes, module
boundaries, control/data flow, CLI surface, config keys, error/exit-status handling. Reference
concrete files under `py/libs/*/src/refitt/…` and `py/apps/*/src/refitt/…` (e.g.
`py/libs/refitt-data/src/refitt/database/model.py`,
`py/apps/refitt-server/src/refitt/server/route/…`). Be specific enough to build from, not so
specific it duplicates the code.>

### Requirement → design map

| R-ID | Design element(s) that satisfy it |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| R1   | <module/function/behavior> |
| R2   | <…> |

## 3. Invariant gate (AGENTS.md constitution check)

Checked against [`.agents/factory/invariants.md`](../../.agents/factory/invariants.md) **before**
research and **again** after this design was drafted. List every load-bearing invariant this change
touches and confirm compliance.

- <invariant, e.g. "invariants.md §2 client boundary" or "§C1 schema dual source of truth"> — <how
  this design honors it>.

### Deviation justifications

Any place this design bends an invariant or adds complexity — with the simpler alternative and why
it was rejected. Empty is the goal. A deliberate redesign of a **Tier 2** current constraint
(invariants.md §C1–§C4) belongs here.

| Deviation | Why needed | Simpler alternative rejected because |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| —         | —         | — |

## 4. Rabbit holes (resolved)

Scary unknowns that could have blown the appetite, and how research settled them (link the relevant
`research/NN-*.md`). This is where risk was bought down before committing to phases.

- <unknown> → <resolution> ([`research/NN-topic.md`](research/NN-topic.md)).

## 5. Risks & open questions

- <residual risk, mitigation, or a question that needs a human before/at build>.

## 6. Verification strategy

How we will *prove* the feature works — the CLI flows to drive and the tests to add/run (this seeds
each phase's `verify:` command in `TECH.md`). Prefer driving the relevant product CLI (`refitt`,
`refitt-server`, `refitt-client`, `refitt-broker`, `refitt-tns`) against a hermetic throwaway DB
over unit tests alone. Pick the tier that matches the phase:

- **`.agents/factory/bin/temp_db.sh <cmd>`** — fast throwaway SQLite; for core/data/most model unit
  phases. Cannot run Postgres-only SQL (the `->>` operator) or the live server/API.
  e.g. `.agents/factory/bin/temp_db.sh sh -c "uv run pytest -m unit tests/test_database"`.
- **`.agents/factory/bin/temp_pg.sh <cmd>`** — ephemeral Postgres (docker by default, or
  `REFITT_TEST_PG=1` to reuse one); for server/API/broker/integration phases. Prefix with
  `REFITT_TEMP_WITH_SERVER=1` to also launch `refitt-server`.
  e.g. `REFITT_TEMP_WITH_SERVER=1 .agents/factory/bin/temp_pg.sh sh -c "uv run pytest tests/test_web"`.
