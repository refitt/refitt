# The REFITT software factory — methodology

This is the reference an agent reads when it needs to understand the spec-driven development
lifecycle that the `rf-*` skills implement. The skills themselves are thin; this is the *why*.
When something here disagrees with a skill, **the skill body is the operating procedure** — fix
this file.

## The lifecycle

One feature (or fix/refactor) flows through five skills, on its own git branch, with every artifact
committed under `spec/{slug}/`:

```
develop ──/rf-feature──▶ feature|fix/{slug}     GOAL.md            (shape: what & why, locked)
             │
             ├──────────/rf-plan──────────▶     research/ PLAN.md TECH.md   (design + phased FSM)
             │
             ├──────────/rf-build──────────▶    source + docs               (execute one phase/loop)
             │            ▲        │
             │            └────────┘  (loop until TECH.md is done)
             │
             ├──────────/rf-review─────────▶     REVIEW.md          (adversarial QA, clean context)
             │            │
             │      changes-requested ──▶ back to /rf-build ;  approved ──▶
             │
             └──────────/rf-publish────────▶     PR → develop   (default)  |  local squash-merge
```

The artifact spine — **`GOAL.md → PLAN.md → TECH.md`** — is the industry-standard spec-driven
skeleton (Spec Kit's `spec→plan→tasks`, Kiro's `requirements→design→tasks`). We commit these into
the repo as an immutable, dated design record ("build in the open"), not as a living source of truth
that must be maintained forever. **Code + `AGENTS.md` remain ground truth; `spec/{slug}/` is a
point-in-time record of intent and design.**

## Load-bearing principles

1. **`AGENTS.md` is the constitution.** We do not invent a `constitution.md`; the skills reference
   `AGENTS.md` and the curated [`invariants.md`](invariants.md). The `rf-plan` invariant gate and the
   `rf-review` footgun checklist both draw from it.
2. **Files + git are the durable substrate.** State lives only in the committed `TECH.md`
   frontmatter, re-read fresh each invocation (via `` !`command` `` injection and the `next_phase.py`
   script). Never rely on conversation memory to carry lifecycle state — `rf-review` runs in a
   separate context and `rf-build` may run days later on another machine.
3. **Parallelism for research, never for building.** `rf-plan` fans out read-only research
   subagents (big wins). `rf-build` is strictly single-threaded and linear — parallel builders make
   conflicting implicit decisions.
4. **Blind, externally-verified review beats self-review.** The reviewer is denied the author's
   PLAN/TECH rationale and must cite executed commands. This is enforced by spawning fresh
   subagents, not by trusting a human to `/clear`.
5. **Ceremony scales to appetite.** The single biggest anti-pattern in 2026 spec-driven tooling is
   uniform heavyweight process — 16 acceptance criteria for a one-line bug fix. `appetite: small`
   (default for `fix/`) skips the research fan-out and may collapse PLAN+TECH; a one-sentence change
   skips the lifecycle entirely.
6. **Never guess.** Ambiguity gets a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` marker and a question to the human,
   recorded into `GOAL.md`. Mirrors AGENTS.md's "the code is ground truth."
7. **Observe cheaply, act deliberately.** The factory improves *itself* through an asymmetric loop:
   every lifecycle skill records harness friction into `spec/{slug}/META.md` for near-zero cost
   (silence by default), but fixes are applied only by the human-gated `rf-harness`, with fresh eyes
   and guardrails that forbid quietly weakening a gate. See "The self-improvement loop" below.

## What we borrow from Shape Up (and what we discard)

Shape Up (37signals) is a team methodology; we take its **cognitive tools** and drop its **org
rituals**.

**Adopt:**
- **Appetite** — fixed budget, variable scope ("start with a number, end with a design"). Expressed
  as a phase/iteration cap, since calendar weeks are meaningless at machine tempo.
- **Shaping** — `GOAL.md` is *rough, solved, and bounded*: concrete enough to de-risk, abstract
  enough to leave design freedom.
- **No-gos** — explicit exclusions in `GOAL.md`.
- **Rabbit holes** — each `research/{topic}.md` investigates one scary unknown that could blow the
  appetite; PLAN records the resolutions.
- **Hill state** — `hill: uphill|crest|downhill` on each phase encodes *risk/confidence* (a
  self-honesty signal). A phase stuck uphill across builds is a raised hand.
- **Scope hammering** — nice-to-haves are cuttable; `rf-review` scope-checks against the appetite.
- **Circuit breaker** — cap build iterations / review bounce-backs; on trip, stop-and-re-shape
  rather than loop forever.

**Discard:** the betting table, six-week/two-week calendar cadence, cool-down, two-track
shaper/builder pipelining, dedicated QA roles — all exist to synchronize and shield a human team and
dissolve for a serial solo+agent pipeline.

**Critical caveat — quality is NOT negotiable here.** Shape Up assumes scope is cuttable and most
bugs can wait. That is **false** for REFITT's load-bearing invariants (auth posture — sha256-hashed
secrets, constant-time compare, the deliberately inverted 403/401 status mapping (§5); schema
integrity — class-definition-time `schema` binding, the `columns`/`relationships` dual source of
truth, FK-safe seed order (§4, §C1, §C3); the capitalized response envelope + request contract (§6);
and import-time fail-fast (§4)): a system with silent auth-bypass, plaintext-secret-leak, or
schema-corruption failure modes cannot defer correctness. The `hammerable: false` phase flag
operationalizes this — `rf-review` must never scope-hammer a correctness/security phase to "fit the
appetite."

```

`.claude` is a symlink to `.agents`, so Claude Code discovers the skills and reads settings through
it. The skills reference the bundled scripts and shared reference material by **repo-relative path**
(`.agents/factory/…`), which keeps them portable. They are meant to run on other harnesses too (Warp,
OpenCode, open-weight models): the Claude-Code-specific affordances (frontmatter, `` !`…` `` state
injection, `AskUserQuestion`, `Agent` fan-out, `ReportFindings`) each have a documented fallback in
[`portability.md`](portability.md), so the factory degrades gracefully rather than breaking.

## The verify substrate is two-tier

REFITT has **no single "drive the whole product" binary** and no single verify site — the product
ships several CLIs (`refitt`, `refitt-server`, `refitt-client`, `refitt-broker`, `refitt-tns`), and a
phase's verify command names the CLI/tests relevant to the change. Verification runs against a
hermetic, throwaway backend chosen per phase:

- **`.agents/factory/bin/temp_db.sh <cmd>`** — fast throwaway **SQLite**; for core/data/most model
  unit phases. Cannot run Postgres-only SQL (the `->>` operator, §C4) or the live server/API. E.g.
  `.agents/factory/bin/temp_db.sh sh -c "uv run pytest -m unit tests/test_database"`.
- **`.agents/factory/bin/temp_pg.sh <cmd>`** — ephemeral **Postgres** (docker by default, or
  `REFITT_TEST_PG=1` to reuse one); for server/API/broker/integration phases. Prefix with
  `REFITT_TEMP_WITH_SERVER=1` to also launch `refitt-server`. E.g.
  `REFITT_TEMP_WITH_SERVER=1 .agents/factory/bin/temp_pg.sh sh -c "uv run pytest tests/test_web"`.

Everything runs via `uv run` against a synced workspace env (`uv sync`). Choosing the wrong tier is a
category error — a Postgres-only query (`->>`, schema-qualified tables, `JSON` variant) will pass
nowhere useful on SQLite (§C4), and the SQLite tier cannot exercise the Flask app/auth at all.

## The self-improvement loop (META.md + `rf-harness`)

The five lifecycle skills improve the *product*; this loop improves the *factory* itself. Skill
friction is otherwise invisible and forgotten between sessions — so each lifecycle skill ends with a
**silence-by-default meta-note step** that appends a finding to the feature's `spec/{slug}/META.md`
**only** when the *skillset itself* cost something. The single load-bearing gate is one test: *"was
this the skill's fault — not mine, not the task's?"* (a merely-hard task, a self-inflicted error, or a
one-off content/code issue that belongs in `GOAL.md`/`REVIEW.md` is **not** a finding).

```
rf-feature ─┐
rf-plan     ├─ meta-note (silence by default) ─► spec/{slug}/META.md   (What worked well + F# findings)
rf-build    │                                          │  (kept OUT of the blind reviewer's context)
rf-review  ─┘  (orchestrator only)                     │
                                                       ▼
rf-publish ──► reads open findings (meta_status.py) ─► "🔧 Harness feedback" block in the PR
                                                       ▼
rf-harness ──► human-gated: shape → preview → apply to .agents/ ─► flip status + log harness-log.md
```

The design is deliberately **asymmetric — cheap to observe, deliberate to act** — so it cannot become a
token-sink or quietly loosen its own guardrails:

- **Producers** (`rf-feature`/`rf-plan`/`rf-build`/`rf-review`) only *record* (≤3 terse findings each),
  never fix. `rf-build` is the richest source (per-phase, across separate invocations — appending to a
  file preserves signal a context reset erases). `rf-review`'s finding is written by the *orchestrator*,
  never the blind reviewer, which must not even read `META.md` (it leaks intent). `META.md` is
  orthogonal to the `GOAL→PLAN→TECH→REVIEW` spine and retained on merge like the rest of `spec/{slug}/`.
- **The applier is separated from the observer** (fresh eyes + a human gate, mirroring blind review).
  `rf-harness` is **human-gated always** and bound by hard guardrails: it **never auto-weakens a
  non-negotiable gate** (tests, CLI-verify, an `invariants.md` item) without an explicit typed override
  — *a finding arguing to loosen a guardrail is itself a warning sign* — prefers an example over a new
  hard rule (fixes must generalize), keeps per-finding **atomic revertable** commits with **post-apply
  verification**, writes **no `META.md` findings** (no meta-on-meta, no recursion), and reads
  `harness-log.md` first so a fix that reverts a recent change or repeats a rejected one is flagged, not
  silently re-applied.

**Observe earns act.** The cheap half (meta-notes + PR surfacing) should prove it produces real signal
over the first few features before the applier is leaned on hard; a finding that recurs across features
(via `rf-harness --all` and the ledger) escalates itself. As with the FSM, the fragile parsing is owned
by a script — `meta_status.py`, stdlib-only (no PyYAML) — not the model.

## Traceability chain

`GOAL.md` R-IDs → `PLAN.md` requirement→design map → `TECH.md` phase `satisfies:` → commits →
`REVIEW.md` requirement→evidence matrix → PR body. Because the repo is squash-only (per-commit
history is destroyed on merge), the committed `spec/{slug}/` folder *is* the retained trace.

Provenance lives in that chain, **not in source comments**: comments explain the invariant/*why* on
their own terms and never embed R-IDs or phase ids (§K4) — those restart per feature and collide
across branches, and mean nothing to a later reader of the merged tree. `git blame → commit → PR →
spec/{slug}/` recovers the requirement behind any line when you need it.
